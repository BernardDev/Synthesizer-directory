## About this Project

<br>

The goal of this project is to ... explore some new styling option ander. Therefore I made use of some morden cocept such as ... Journey through the history of synthesizers bla bla

### Leading topics:

<br>

> [INFINITE SCROLLING](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-directory) <br>

The main page of the application is a page where a user can scroll through a (time)line of synthesizer images that pop-up from both sides. To make this happen I implemented lazyloading with Intersection Observer, UseRef & UseCallback. Intersection Observer triggered the fetching of a new batch of images by observing an actual DOM element, beeing the last synth on the page. For this to work I needed to refference this element with UseRef.

<br>

> [STYLED COMPONETNS](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-directory) <br>

Making this frontend gave me the chance of exploring Styled Components

<br>

> [VALIDATION & ERROR HANDLING](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/server) <br>

Validation was done with Yup, used in the [backend](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/server/app.js) as well as the [frontend](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/client/src/pages/Autorization.js). Together with [middlewares](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/server/validators) to safeguarded the routes from user errors and send meaningful feedback to the client when they do occur.
Also validated in the backend: multipart/form-data & attachments.

> [AUTHENTIFICATION & PASSWORD HASHING](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/server/app.js) <br>

To be able to control the flow of user suggested synthesizers I implemented a admin login-system with JWT token. Although this was not my first encounter with this, it was the first time that I implemented it inside of my [model](https://github.com/BernardDev/Synthesizer-API/tree/development/server/models/admin.js) and validated expiration of the token. Hashing/comparing of the user's password is also done in the model directly.
